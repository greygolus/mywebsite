Please make the following visual and functional improvements to the current homepage of my website. These changes should match the site’s existing translucent, zoom-based design direction and emphasize smooth, modern interactivity. Keep the current scroll structure and layout fully intact.

✅ 1. Navigation Bar — Personal Projects Dropdown
Visual Style:

Update the dropdown menu for “Personal Projects” to match the site's translucent/glass UI theme

Use Tailwind classes like:

tailwind
Copy
Edit
bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-md border border-white/20 rounded-lg shadow-lg text-white
Apply subtle hover:backdrop-blur-lg and light border glow for a futuristic look

Behavioral Fixes:

Ensure the dropdown menu does not close when the user hovers over the title and moves their cursor diagonally down to select a submenu item

This may require adjusting the mouseleave timing or hitbox detection

Functionality should be consistent across desktop and touchpad users

Interaction Improvements:

Add hover:bg-white/20 or similar feedback when hovering over individual items

Ensure each item in the dropdown is fully clickable and keyboard accessible

✅ 2. Improve Animation Quality Throughout Homepage
Smooth out all current animations on the homepage — especially transitions between scroll stages and UI elements — by applying:

ease-in-out or ease-[cubic-bezier] curves for more natural easing

Replace choppy or abrupt motion with interpolated transitions using framer-motion or Tailwind’s transition-all duration-500

Focus areas:

Zoom transitions for background elements

Scaling + fading animations for text blocks or content containers

Smooth hover effects on buttons or links (hover:scale-105, transition duration-300)

Avoid lag or “snapping” by:

Throttling excessive scroll events (if applicable)

Using requestAnimationFrame-based smoothing where necessary

Preventing layout shifts by locking element dimensions

⚠️ Additional Notes:
Do not introduce new scroll sections, layout changes, or delays in animation triggers

Ensure these upgrades are lightweight enough to keep performance smooth on mid-range devices

Test interactions in both light and dark backgrounds to confirm readability and interaction consistency
