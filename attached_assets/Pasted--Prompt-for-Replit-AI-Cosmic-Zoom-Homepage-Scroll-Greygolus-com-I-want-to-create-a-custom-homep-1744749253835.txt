✅ Prompt for Replit AI — Cosmic Zoom Homepage Scroll (Greygolus.com)
I want to create a custom homepage scroll animation for my Next.js + Tailwind CSS website, greygolus.com. This should be a cinematic, scroll-driven zoom experience that starts at the largest scale of the universe and ends at the subatomic scale, with key text reveals at each layer.

🔭 Scene Progression — Scroll Triggers + Zoom Stages
Each stage should fill the screen (min-h-screen), use position: sticky, and create a smooth zoom/transition effect between layers using transform: scale, opacity, or animated parallax layers. Backgrounds can use placeholder gradients/images for now, but must be easily swappable.


Stage	Background Visual	Text Reveal
1	Galaxy clusters / purple cosmic web	“It begins beyond what we can see...”
2	Spiral galaxy	“The story of light stretches across galaxies.”
3	Oort cloud	“Zoom in, past frozen dust and ancient comets.”
4	Solar system	“Into the solar system, a dance of motion and fire.”
5	Earth from orbit	“Toward a pale blue dot...”
6	Telescope on Earth	“Where we watch the skies from the ground.”
7	Human eyeball (close-up)	“And see, not just through instruments...”
8	DNA / cell structures	“...but through biology.”
9	Atom (orbitals)	“Through the tiniest building blocks.”
10	Atomic nucleus	“Deeper still, past protons and neutrons...”
11	Quarks / gluons	“...to the fabric of everything.”
12	Final particle loop	“This is the scale of optics. Welcome.”
🎨 Visual & Animation Requirements
Use Tailwind CSS and framer-motion or react-scrollama for scroll-based sequencing

Backgrounds must fade or transform smoothly

Text must fade/slide in per section (animate-fade-in, translate-y)

Keep the final background scene fixed after stage 12, with subtle particle motion

Use bg-gradient-to-r, bg-cover, or custom animated layers (SVGs or divs)

🧪 Dev Notes
Each stage should be its own component or render block

Use placeholder visuals for now (gradient divs, simple starfields, SVG blobs)

I will later swap in custom images or canvas layers manually

Must be mobile responsive, and optimized for smooth scrolling

Scroll must follow a natural linear or ease-in-out progression — avoid abrupt jumps

📍Important Follow-ups (for later fixes)
Fade out “Scroll to Explore” after the first scroll section to make room for a vertical scroll progress bar

Make the buttons at the end clickable (even with placeholder links for now)

Remove the footer entirely on the homepage

Ensure all sections have full-width layout and match dark mode styling from the rest of the site (bg-[#1e1e20], white text, gradient headers, etc.)

This homepage is the core of greygolus.com — it should feel like a journey from the edge of the universe to the fundamental particles of reality, brought to life with modern scrolling animation and precision visuals.
