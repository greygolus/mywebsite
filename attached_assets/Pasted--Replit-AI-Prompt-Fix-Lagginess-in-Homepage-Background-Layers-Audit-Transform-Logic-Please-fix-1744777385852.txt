‚úçÔ∏è Replit AI Prompt ‚Äî Fix Lagginess in Homepage Background Layers + Audit Transform Logic
Please fix the performance and lag issues affecting the animated backgrounds on my homepage. This does not affect the text card overlays ‚Äî those are functioning correctly and should not be modified.

‚úÖ 1. Background Animation Lag Fixes
Review and optimize all scroll-linked background layers across homepage scroll stages

Focus specifically on reducing janky scroll behavior, skipped frames, or GPU overload

Apply the following performance improvements:

a. ‚úÖ Use Only GPU-Friendly CSS Properties
Animate only transform: scale(), rotate(), translate3d() ‚Äî avoid top, left, width, height, filter, or background-position

Add will-change: transform or will-change: opacity to any motion layer to hint GPU acceleration

b. ‚úÖ Throttle Scroll-based Updates
If using framer-motion or scrollYProgress, ensure it‚Äôs throttled and not updating the DOM on every small scroll tick

Use useMemo or useEffect to reduce recalculations

Avoid nested motion.divs triggering layout reflows at the same time

c. ‚úÖ Use layout={false} for Non-layout Motion
In framer-motion background layers, disable layout animation tracking unless absolutely needed:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<motion.div layout={false} />
‚úÖ 2. Style + Transform Conflicts Audit
Please check for weird or conflicting CSS combinations that might be affecting performance:

Look for any background layers that have multiple transforms applied simultaneously (e.g., a scale() from one animation and a translateZ() or rotate() from another at the same time)

Eliminate any redundant transforms ‚Äî don't nest scale() within another scale(), or apply opacity transitions within a component that is already being faded via scroll logic

Avoid deeply nested transforms unless all parent layers are static or GPU-friendly

If using custom scroll math to move or zoom elements:

Normalize scroll values (e.g., use percentages or [0, 1] values) before applying to transforms

Avoid multiplying values across layers without constraining the output ‚Äî extreme values can cause weird visual behavior or overdraw

‚úÖ 3. Image / Video Background Optimization
Make sure any background video has:

playsInline, autoPlay, muted, loop

poster fallback and appropriate compression (WebM or MP4 < 4MB)

Make sure any image backgrounds are:

.webp compressed and under 1MB

Using bg-cover bg-center instead of bg-fixed (which causes repaints on some devices)

üö´ Do Not Change:
Any text cards or container styles

Any recently fixed transparency or bubble styling

Any scroll trigger timing or route logic
