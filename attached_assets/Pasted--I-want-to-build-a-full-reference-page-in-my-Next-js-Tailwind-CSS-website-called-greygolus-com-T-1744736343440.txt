I want to build a full /reference page in my Next.js + Tailwind CSS website called greygolus.com. This page contains three large, clean, categorized tables:
	•	Symbols Table
	•	Constants Table
	•	Formulas Table

PAGE STRUCTURE & DESIGN:
	•	Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.
	•	Each section should be visually separated (with headers like h2 or h3, padding, border, etc.).
	•	Tables should be:
	•	Fully responsive
	•	Have clearly labeled columns
	•	Styled with alternating row colors or hover effects for readability
	•	Use semantic HTML tables for all three

SECTION 1: Symbols Table
This table shows variables commonly used in optics and photonics formulas.
Column
Description
Symbol
Can include multiple versions (e.g. ν / f)
Name
Full name of the symbol
Description
What it represents in optics
Units
Standard units used in calculators
SI Base Units
Breakdown of base SI units (e.g. kg·m²/s²)

All symbols from my compiled data must be included (already reviewed and deduplicated). Examples include λ, n, θ₁, I, Φ, R, α, etc.

SECTION 2: Constants Table
This table includes all physics constants used in the calculators. It must contain the following columns:
Column
Description
Name
Constant name (e.g., Planck’s constant)
Symbol
Short symbol (e.g., h)
Exact Value
The CODATA value (or symbolic expression like 4π × 10⁻⁷)
Approx. Value
A rounded, more human-readable version
Units
Standard units (e.g., J·s, C, N/A²)
SI Base Units
Full SI breakdown (e.g., kg·m²/s)

Add a toggle switch above the table labeled “Use Approximate Values” that toggles the “Value” column between Exact and Approximate values without refreshing the page (e.g. using state, useState, onClick, etc.).

SECTION 3: Formulas Table
This table contains all key formulas organized by topic. Display all formulas cleanly with math formatting or inline code if needed.
Column
Description
Formula
The actual equation (e.g. E = hν = hc/λ)
What It Describes
The purpose or application of the formula
Variables
List of all symbols involved in the equation

Group formulas into clear subsections, like:
	•	Wave / Energy / Frequency
	•	Angles (Snell’s Law, Critical Angle, Brewster)
	•	Lenses & Mirrors
	•	Diffraction / Interference
	•	Efficiency / Power / Visibility
You can use collapsible sections, headers, or spacing to visually separate categories.

BEHAVIOR & OTHER NOTES:
	•	This page should be responsive and mobile-friendly.
	•	Use proper HTML table tags (<table>, <thead>, <tbody>, etc.).
	•	Make each table easy to edit or expand in future.
	•	Don’t hardcode formula rendering with LaTeX (unless that’s already supported), just show equations in <code> or styled text for now.

This /reference page is part of a broader “Optics Unified” project on my site, and will be linked via the “Directory” and/or “Personal Projects” sections of the navbar. It supports the backend logic for my calculators and learning tools.
Make this clean, modular, and fully functional.
